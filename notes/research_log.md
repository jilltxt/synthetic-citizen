- First meeting after summer. Before the break we got 'generate.py' to work: it generates a random set of demographic characteristics and sends them to the API with a survey question. This creates a csv that matches the NCP output.
- We should test different LLMs, e.g. a Norwegian one. Talk with S about this, or people at NB? Might also be worth testing with models that aren't fine-tuned since this may be why results are usually 3 or 4 out of 5, with no outliers. Will continue prototyping with OpenAI models.
- Add demographic variables: education, employment sector.
